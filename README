# apt-fast v1.7 by Matt Parnell http://www.mattparnell.com, GNU GPLv3+
# Use this just like aptitude or apt-get for faster package downloading.

====================
About:
====================

apt-fast is a shellscript wrapper for apt-get that can drastically improve apt download
times by downloading packages in parallel, with multiple connections per package.

BE SURE to look at the tags in the repo, as some are distro specific, and may contain
files you need for autocompletion.

====================
Setup/Install:
====================

You can use PPA to get automatical configuration file setup, for details see:
https://code.launchpad.net/~apt-fast/+archive/stable

Some distros, such as PCLinuxOS include apt-fast in their repos.

For those of you who want to manually install it, download it and perform the following:

cp ./apt-fast /usr/sbin/
chmod +x /usr/sbin/apt-fast
cp ./apt-fast.conf /etc

You need to have a good download manager installed - aria2c and axel are favorites
for this script. Make sure and open /etc/apt-fast.conf in a text editor and uncomment the line
for your download manager before using it, and configure the other options as well.

apt-get install aria2
OR
apt-get install axel

Then, you should be ready to use it - simply run apt-fast instead of apt-get any time
you find yourself needing to manage packages!


Bash autocompletion:
===================
cp ./apt-fast.comp /etc/bash_completion.d/apt-fast
chown root /etc/bash_completion.d/apt-fast
. /etc/bash_completion


Man page installation:
===================
cp ./man/apt-fast.8 /usr/share/man/man8
gzip -f9 /usr/share/man/man8/apt-fast.8
cp ./man/apt-fast.conf.5 /usr/share/man/man5
gzip -f9 /usr/share/man/man5/apt-fast.conf.5
