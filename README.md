apt-fast 1.8
============
apt-fast is a shellscript wrapper for apt-get and aptitude that can drastically
improve apt download times by downloading packages in parallel, with multiple
connections per package.


Setup/Install
-------------
### PPA ###
You can use the PPA to get a graphical configuration file setup and automatic
updates, for details see:
[ppa:apt-fast/stable](https://code.launchpad.net/~apt-fast/+archive/stable).

Some distros, such as PCLinuxOS include apt-fast in their repos.


### Manual ###
For those of you who want to manually install it, download it and perform the
following:

    cp apt-fast /usr/bin/
    chmod +x /usr/bin/apt-fast
    cp apt-fast.conf /etc

You need to have [aria2c](http://aria2.sourceforge.net/) installed:

    apt-get install aria2

Then, you should be ready to use it - simply run apt-fast instead of apt-get
or aptitude any time you find yourself needing to manage packages!


### Multiple mirrors ###
It is recommended to add some local mirrors to share bandwidth with multiple
mirrors and don't heavily pull from a single server. This will also speedup
download.  
Look at your distribution's archive mirror list and select some mirrors.
 * Debian: http://www.debian.org/mirror/list
 * Ubuntu: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors
Then add them to whitespace and comma separated list in config file, e.g.:
    MIRRORS=( 'http://ftp.debian.org/debian,http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian,http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian,ftp://ftp.uni-kl.de/debian'
              'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu,http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu,http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/ubuntu,http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/ubuntu,http://mirror.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pub/linux/distributions/ubuntu/' )

*NOTE:* Write also your mirrors listed in your sources.list into that list to
make sure associated mirrors are handled properly. Remember: Commas separate
mirrors for same archive, whitespaces separate different archives (e.g.
official archive and PPA are different archives).


### Autocompletion ###
#### Bash ####
    cp completions/bash/apt-fast /etc/bash_completion.d/
    chown root:root /etc/bash_completion.d/apt-fast
    . /etc/bash_completion

#### Zsh ####
    cp completions/zsh/_apt-fast /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Debian/
    chown root:root /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Debian/_apt-fast
    source /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Debian/_apt-fast


### Manual page installation ###
    cp ./man/apt-fast.8 /usr/share/man/man8
    gzip -f9 /usr/share/man/man8/apt-fast.8
    cp ./man/apt-fast.conf.5 /usr/share/man/man5
    gzip -f9 /usr/share/man/man5/apt-fast.conf.5
